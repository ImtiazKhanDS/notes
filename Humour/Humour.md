#### Use Humour to leave your mark
                 - Kevin Hart

1. There is humour in everything if you choose to find it.
2. In your darkest moments you gotta find the light.
3. Don’t be to serious , find humour and laugh at yourself.
4. You can teach people how to joke , you can teach people idea behind the joke but you can’t teach people to be funny , funniness is inbuilt in the character of a person.

2. Make your environment active , make an environment of movers
3. Being honest is funny
4. Everybody goes to a person with a sense of humour to shake hands or do hifi’s since they relate it easily.

7. Create a nucleus (overall subject ) and stay in it : Example : How life is at 40 ?
8. Know your beginning, know your middle and know your ending 
9. Owning the room wit humour , humour enables to take control of an environment
