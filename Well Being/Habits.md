**Getting 1 percent better**

    Thing big act small

1. Do something consistently small to unlock elite results.
2. Instead of thinking about what can I do on my best day , think about what can I cover even on my worst day.
3. It wasn’t the last workout that made what you are , but it was the ones that came before , accumulation leads to gains

**Goal vs system**

1. Iceberg analogy , the surface of the iceberg is the goal , the under the surface is the system.
2. Identify goals you want to achieve
3. Break the goals into smaller habits
4. Repeat daily habits over time to create a system
5. Spend the vast majority of time in building a better system.
6. Goals have an endpoint , systems last forever 
7. If you reclaim the habit as fast as you could the breaking of it doesn’t matter much
8. Goals are about results, systems are about process
9. Start with systems
