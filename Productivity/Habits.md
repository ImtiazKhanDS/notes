**Getting 1 percent better**

    Thing big act small

1. Do something consistently small to unlock elite results.
2. Instead of thinking about what can I do on my best day , think about what can I cover even on my worst day.
3. It wasn’t the last workout that made what you are , but it was the ones that came before , accumulation leads to gains

**Goal vs system**

1. Iceberg analogy , the surface of the iceberg is the goal , the under the surface is the system.
2. Identify goals you want to achieve
3. Break the goals into smaller habits
4. Repeat daily habits over time to create a system
5. Spend the vast majority of time in building a better system.
6. Goals have an endpoint , systems last forever 
7. If you reclaim the habit as fast as you could the breaking of it doesn’t matter much
8. Goals are about results, systems are about process
9. Start with systems when you want to change your goals
10. Goals are short term , systems are long term.

**Habits make our Identity** 

1. The stories that you tell about yourself are they serving you or hindering you ?

     1. Identity : I am a person who writes each day
     2. System : Write 100 words each day
5. Example : *To get in shape*
     1. Identity : I am a person who doesn’t miss workouts
     2. System : Wake up early , get dressed and exercise.
 6. Example : *To improve your relationship*
     1. I am a type of person who makes partner’s life easier 
     2. Find one thing each day that I can take of their plate
7. **Creating a new habit**
     1. Take your ultimate goal
     2. Translate the goal into an identity
     3. Figure out a process that reinforces being that person.
 
 **The Habit Feedback loop**
  1. *Habit* : The strategies we follow to solve the problems we repeatedly face.
  2. Four stages of a habit feedback loop
     1. **Cue** : The trigger that tells the brain to initiate the habit 
     2. **Craving** : The desire or motivation for a particular outcome
     3. **Response** : The thought or action you take to form the habit
     4. **Reward** : The payoff you get from the habit
 3. What are the odds that the habits you have are the optimal way to solve problems that you face in life ? Very unlikely 

**Laws of behavioural change**

1. **Make it obvious**
   1. Diderot effect: When one action leads to another action 
   2. Example Diderot effect : I go to the washroom -> I wash my hands -> Dry my hands -> Use the towel -> Oh I need to do the laundry -> Oh I have to go to buy some detergents.
