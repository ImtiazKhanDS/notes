**Getting 1 percent better**

    Thing big act small

1. Do something consistently small to unlock elite results.
2. Instead of thinking about what can I do on my best day , think about what can I cover even on my worst day.
3. It wasn’t the last workout that made what you are , but it was the ones that came before , accumulation leads to gains

**Goal vs system**

1. Iceberg analogy , the surface of the iceberg is the goal , the under the surface is the system.
2. Identify goals you want to achieve
3. Break the goals into smaller habits
4. Repeat daily habits over time to create a system
5. Spend the vast majority of time in building a better system.
6. Goals have an endpoint , systems last forever 
7. If you reclaim the habit as fast as you could the breaking of it doesn’t matter much
8. Goals are about results, systems are about process
9. Start with systems when you want to change your goals
10. Goals are short term , systems are long term.

**Habits make our Identity** 

1. The stories that you tell about yourself are they serving you or hindering you ?
2. Determine who you want to become
3. Create habits that support that identity 
4. Example :*Become a writer*
     1. Identity : I am a person who writes each day
     2. System : Write 100 words each day
5. Example : *To get in shape*
     1. Identity : I am a person who doesn’t miss workouts
     2. System : Wake up early , get dressed and exercise.
 6. Example : *To improve your relationship*
     1. I am a type of person who makes partner’s life easier 
     2. Find one thing each day that I can take of their plate
7. **Creating a new habit**
     1. Take your ultimate goal
     2. Translate the goal into an identity
     3. Figure out a process that reinforces being that person.
 
 **The Habit Feedback loop**
  1. *Habit* : The strategies we follow to solve the problems we repeatedly face.
  2. Four stages of a habit feedback loop
     1. **Cue** : The trigger that tells the brain to initiate the habit 
     2. **Craving** : The desire or motivation for a particular outcome
     3. **Response** : The thought or action you take to form the habit
     4. **Reward** : The payoff you get from the habit
 3. What are the odds that the habits you have are the optimal way to solve problems that you face in life ? Very unlikely 

**Laws of behavioural change**

1. **Make it obvious**
   1. Diderot effect: When one action leads to another action 
   2. Example Diderot effect : I go to the washroom -> I wash my hands -> Dry my hands -> Use the towel -> Oh I need to do the laundry -> Oh I have to go to buy some detergents.
   3. The momentum that feeds from one action to another in Diderot effect can also be used while building habits
   4. By this you not only make it easy for yourself to show up every day but also, you make it easy to win every day.
   5. Template Have clear plan: I will perform X behaviour on this day  at this place on this time?
   6. Example : I will get a flue  shot on November 14 at government hospital at 9 AM
   7. The more you do these specific behaviours the more momentum you gain the more rewarding it will be.
   8. You don’t need motivation what you need is implementation intentions with which you are likely to do something than waiting for motivation to strike you.
   9. Behaviour change starts with self awareness 
   10. Set an implementation intention.
   
2. **Make it Attractive**
   1. Getting somebody involved in the habit
   2. Come up with a ritual that feels right and makes you plugged in.
   3. Reframe your mindset , instead of saying oh I have to do lot of work say I get the opportunity to do productive work.
   4. Change Obligation to opportunity.
   5. Social expectations help you stay on the habit.
   6. The more attractive a behaviour the forming it is.
   7. Reprogram your story
   8. Reframe your mindset from “have to” to “get to”
   9. Socialise your habit
3. **Make it easy**
   1. Motion is often preparation , research or planning or the things that you do before you take an action 
   2. Action is the type of thing that delivers the result that you are looking for. 
   3. Example : Reading is motion , writing is action.
   4. Example : Going to the gym and talking to a personal trainer is a motion whereas getting under the bar and doing a set of squats is an action.
   5. Motion is fine if it complements the action you are taking.
   6. Habit shaping : You start with an easy version of the habit , you build it more gradually into a larger version.
   7. Example : You start running with 1 mile then 2 miles , then 5 miles , later half marathon, leading up to a marathon.
   8. 2minute rule : Whatever habit you are trying to create , can you roll it down to 2 minutes.
   9. Example : Read 30 books an year  -> 2minute rule -> read 1 page 
   10. Know the difference between action and motion
   11. Shape your habits to make them stick
   12. Use the 2 minute rule.
4. **Make it satisfying** 
   1. A lot of returns while building habits are delayed.
   2. Example : You are working out since a month but no signs of change 
   3. It’s better to have a long time line but also have some signals of progress each day.
   4. Signals of progress gives you momentum
   5. Visual measures help demonstrate your progress, and making progress is highly satisfying.
   6. We likely stick to a habit when our experience is satisfying 
   7. Reward the good habit immediately 
   8. What is immediately rewarded is repeated 
   9. Track progress to become successful
