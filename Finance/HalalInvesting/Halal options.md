1. Liquidity: How quickly you can encash
2. Volatility : simply means prices go up and down
3. For individual haram investments e.g shares in an alchohol manufacturer, you should divest from such assets as soon as you can. Let's say you bought 5000 rs/- of Diageo shares which are now worth 5200, you should sell those immediately and give away the 200 profit and keep the 5000 (assuming you made the 5000 from halal sources before investing.)
4. A more complex problem occurs if your haram investments are comingled with halal investments , In that case calculate the percentage of Fund that is amounting to haram allocation , for example lets say 44 % , So you have to give away 44% of the profits and keep the rest.
5. In certain cases its more complicated than this , for example only lets say only 75 % of the fund is in equities , rest is in debt, or fixed interest etc. 
6. Fund : 74.14% equities, 14.49 % bonds and 8.08 % derivatives, of this lets say 27% is haram equities , so now total haram section = 27%* 74.14%. + 14.49% + 8.08%  = 42.87% , Unfortunately in this case around 42.87% of profits will be derived, Therefore if you have profited 1000 rs/- over a period of 5 years , then you have to give away 420 rs/-
7. Shorting : When businesses perform poorly , certain fund managers get very exicited , since it opens up the possibility of "shorting". Shorting is a mechanism that allows you to borrow shares from an existing shareholder , sell those shares on the market , as long as you promise to give those shares back to the shareholder from whom you borrowed them. Where the share prices decrease in that
