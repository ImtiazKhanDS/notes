          Paul Krugman

1. Paul believes that at its heart , economics is about people , how they earn their living and how they spend their income
2. The invisible hand : Adam smith’s notion that each individual’s economic self interest can contribute to the greater economic good under certain market conditions.
3. Economics makes us thinks better. 
4. Fundamental principles of economics 
   1. People respond to incentives 
   2. Each transaction has an equal give and take
5. Your sale is my purchase
6. You have to understand the past to improve your future
7. Wealth of a country doesn’t reside in gold or silver but in the production of goods , in short in productivity 
8. Productivity depends upon people doing different things
9. Wealth is about what you can do rather than holding on to what you have 
10. Say's it’s that supply creates its own demand, So in an economy, whenever there is a productive growth through supply , demand follows it. But this may not necessarily be true because there were times that the great depression happened, and there were times where recession kicked in, even though the countries economy was productive.
11. The more the interest rate given by banks the more people will try to economise on that.
12. LM (liquidity/ money preference) curve if the economy expands the people would need more supply of more money because of which interest increase. People need more cash for doing transactions, The higher is the interest rate the higher is GDP.
14. IS curve (investment and savings ) if the federal cuts the interest rate , people will borrow more spend more spending the economy expands , gdp increases

   16. **Bank run** : A cyclical process where anxieties over a bank’s instability cause large groups of people to withdraw their money thereby making a bank more and more unstable
   17. **Shadow banking** Financial activities like offering credit which takes place outside the parameters of the federal  oversight 
   18. **Ponzi scheme** : A fraudulent investment offered in an asset that doesn’t exist where funds from new investors are paid as returns to the previous investors 
   19. **Zero lower bound** : The point at which interest rates fall to zero and at which the federal can no longer stimulate economic activity by printing more money
   20. **Liquidity trap** : The point at which the returns on investments become so low that , people would rather hold money than invest.
   21. Financial crisis will happen here and there the only solution to that is having a system which is kind of a shock absorber to reduce the impact, Banks should have enough reserves and should have a safety net.
   22. There is a growing gap of income . There are only few who hold the majority of the income which poses a danger to the economy.
   23. Income is what you earn either through salary or through stock dividends, wealth is
