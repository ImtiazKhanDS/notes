#### The art of story telling
      ~ Michael Lewis

  Story telling is a muscle , if you develop it,   It ends up improving your life.


**Stocks , Stats and finding your story**

1. You need a story because facts don’t stick story does.
2. The simplest mistake that writers think is that the material is inside them as opposed to outside them 
3. Tell the stories that entertain and engage you 
4. Practice writing for someone who loves you
5. If something is fun to read that is your voice .
6. If you read it aloud you will notice something’s that are dead spots and boring , you can catch those and change it.
7. Try your story with a group of friends observe their reaction and see where it’s working .
8. Ears understand the emotion of a story eyes don’t, If you listen to a story you get emotionally connected to it rather than when you just read it with your eyes.
9. Don’t go hunting for ideas , just be alive what interests you in the world.
10. When you find something interesting just note it down , come back to it later.
11. Pay attention to your curiosity because your curiosity will lead to a passion on the page
12. You can make anything interesting or important by just the power of your curiosity 
13. Some of the best books written about are things that you would never imagine a book would be written about.
14. Boil your story down to the essence and then you explode all your thoughts around it. The essence is the hub and all your points around are perspectives, facts etc.
15. You want the topic to lead you to the character or vice versa , they go together hand in hand.
16. Find a character you want to follow
17. Allow characters to take over your story even if conventional wisdom is that’s not about who you are writing a story about.
18. Taking somebody who is unimportant and saying no this person is very important to the story.
19. Be curious about your characters.
20. You can move the spotlight to the characters you want to show, Don’t stick to write about characters that are famous , In that case you will be saying something which the reader knows already.
21. Find the motive behind your characters 
22. Find the gold by thinking about things differently , some view which is not expressed, some character which other people think unimportant, some story that no one cares about.
23. Characters motive : Why they do what they do ?
    1. Look at their past
    2. What are their triggers ?
    3. What are their obsessions?
    4. What are their goals ?
    5. What are their needs ?
24. People do things for a reason just be alive to what that reason could be.
25. Listen to how people tell stories
26. Some people tell the stories where they are always the victim , some people tell the stories where they are the smartest person, some people tell stories where they are lucky or grateful. It’s your job as a writer to only write how you see it and hope things may fall in.
27. An analogy of a writer is like a tape recorder , looking at your own recording first time on a tape recorder you may say , that’s not me or I don’t know I sounded like that or that’s  little different or I don’t want to hear it . But the tape recorder is not lying, it actually giving you what you sound like. A writers job is to be the tape recorder 
28. Getting your subjects to open up
29. You have to create an environment for your subject where they feel safe to open up.
30. Make yourself an useful listener 

**Tackles Sub-primes Crypto and Premonitions**

1. Slow down the action 
2. Even casual conversations could lead to your next story.
3. Look for friction between perception and reality 
4. Places where the whole world is looking wrong and you can show it . It’s a huge opportunity when you can explain a mistake the world is making in the form of a character
5. Parallel plot structure
   1. Incorporate multiple stories linked by common characters or themes
   2. The stories unfold concurrently 
   3. The stories provide multiple hooks to pique the interest of your audience 
6. Broadly what I am doing in this world as a writer is filtering what is interesting and organising it into a story.
7. The process starts by talking to people or wandering around and observing scenes
8. Building blocks of a story are characters scenes and explanations 
9. Cards
   1. Orange : characters
   2. Yellow : scenes
   3. Green : explanations
10. Using these card structures and reshuffling them you can inexpensively play with the structure and gives chance to argue with your own structure.
11. Figure out your beginning and end before you start.
12. If you have a beginning and ending then you can create a relationship between those two structures , For example end where you have begun.
13. There’s something timeless about the structure where you come back to the place where you started.
14. General advice : shorter is always better, if you want to write a 500 page book , make it 280. If you want to write a 30 word sentence make it 15.
15. Verbosity gets in the way of meaning and connecting so it’s like make it punchier.
16. Infuse your characters with personal stakes.
17. The most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slow-witted man if he has not formed any idea of them already , but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already.
18. The trick to explain complex things is to create the characters that you are attached to.
19. Don’t feel the need to prove how smart you are 
20. Make the reader feel smart rather than making yourself smart and reader feel stupid through your writing. Make the reader understand.
21. Some of the things you should simplify and leave it out to make the reader understand, knowingly that it’s a vulnerability since you didn’t go to the details , There would be someone who would question that, But you have to take that risk so that reader gets it in a digestible way.
22. Kill your darlings , You have to exclude some parts from your book which are not really adding anything to the story.
23. Add strength or importance to your character 
24. Ask your character for information on multiple situations 
25. Know the character’s environment 
26. If it’s in your head as a picture it’s so much easier to paint that picture in readers mind.
27. Walk a mile in your characters shoes.
28. A discovery process in the environment of a character could lead to gold.
29. Insist on your view of the character and story. You will likely running against the characters view of themselves.

**Start to Finish**

1. Make the book into little manageable tasks.
2. Have your own space and environment where you don’t get distracted 
3. Create a small private space so that you associate that place with writing so that you minimise distractions 
4. It’s useful to have a routine but don’t be superstitious. Make your Routine loose or flexible
5. Don’t get up until you have 1000 words
