1. What is a hypermedia control ?

	Consider a simple anchor tag, embedded within a larger HTML document:
	
	```html
	<a href="https://hypermedia.systems/">
	  Hypermedia Systems
	</a>
	```
	
	An anchor tag consists of the tag itself, `<a></a>`, as well as the attributes and content within the tag. Of particular interest is the `href` attribute, which specifies a _hypertext reference_ to another document or document fragment. It is this attribute that makes the anchor tag a hypermedia control.
