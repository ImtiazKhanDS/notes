~ In conversation with Noam Chomsky

1. When you go to social media , you are going into a self reinforcing bubble where your own views are replicated and expanded.
2. In some sense it’s polarising and creating extreme views.
3. Media manipulates independent thinking and has a lasting effect towards one’s views and perspectives.

**Manufacturing consent**

5. **Ownership** : Media are major corporations owned by mega corporations, For example companies like Disney and Time Warner have huge stakes in media corporations.
6. **Advertising Model** : Till 19th century the media model was funded by subscribers in order to support independent media , later the founding fathers realised this has to move to an advertising model so there was a shift of funding from subscribers to advertisers.

3. We don’t own the truth , We don’t know the truth , we do our best which is try to get the powerless to think for themselves
4. Some Truths can only be achieved by activism, For example women’s rights , civil rights etc.
5. What people should be worried about now are institutional structures which are directed to profit and power for the few.
6. There is a large decline in the unions. What is interesting is everybody is becoming isolated , common opinions and perspectives which forms a union are demolished because of this isolated world. This way it’s easy to persuade you or me to join them instead of opposing them. They feed their ideologies into you through technology and you lose the power of thinking independently.
7. Example : Climate scientists have been warning that by the end of this century Eastern Mediterranean is heating more rapidly than the rest of the world. Temperatures will have risen 5 degree Celsius. Sea levels will have risen by 2 to 2.5 metres ~ 10 feet roughly , what happens when
