~ In conversation with Noam Chomsky

1. When you go to social media , you are going into a self reinforcing bubble where your own views are replicated and expanded.
2. In some sense it’s polarising and creating extreme views.
3. Media manipulates independent thinking and has a lasting effect towards one’s views and perspectives.
4. Media are major corporations owned by mega corporations, For example companies like Disney and Time Warner have huge stakes in media corporations
